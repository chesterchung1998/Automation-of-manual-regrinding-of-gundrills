# Automation-of-manual-regrinding-of-gundrills
An in-depth final year project which analyzes and evaluates the pros and cons of the existing manual regrinding process of gundrills. Possible designs using a robotic arm are proposed in this paper, and simulations and results are discussed to validate the ideas based on factors such as efficiency, accuracy and safety.
